We are excited to continue making capital improvements to Meadow Ridge Apartments. Past projects include parking lot seal-coating and repainting, professional landscaping, and roof and insulation replacement. Many units have new Luxury Vinyl Plank flooring, stainless steel appliances, upgraded windows, and fresh paint. In the summer of 2021 the boiler/hot water heating system was replaced with all new high-efficiency and stainless steel components. In Fall 2022, we replaced the carpet in the building common spaces and began repainting the hallways.
